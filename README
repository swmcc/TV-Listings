This code is very old - but it works. If for some made reson you do want to use it then of course feel free however 
I would use DBIx::Class instead of Class::DBI - just because it is a bit nicer but YMMV. In fact I'd just use whatever
is in bin/ - am pretty sure that the KinoSearch code wont work anymore though.
